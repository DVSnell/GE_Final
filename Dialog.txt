OTHERWISE

Judge: This Tribunal has reached a decision regarding the evidence of the accused broadcasting advanced technological data over unsecured frequencies in a star system known to have signal interception capabilities.  Per the Admirality Code of Justice, Section Seven, Articles Nine Through Twenty-Two, we find the Accused guilty of all charges.  The penalty for these transgressions is--
Inquisitor:  A word, Commodore.
Judge:  You may approach.

<Footsteps and Robes>

Inquisitor: <Whispering>  The Inquisition requests that the usual punishment be waved and that the accused instead be punished with cumpulsory service with the Civil Defense Corps.
Judge: <Whispering>  These charges are severe and have not been seen in decades.  The standard punishment of permanent exile to a savage world will remind others of this severity.
Inquisitor: <Whispering>  True, but the Inquisition believes this case has extenuating circumstances based on previous aptitude tests administered to the Accused.
Judge: <Whispering>  With all due respect--
Inquisitor: <Whispering>  We wish the Accused to stay with the Fleet.  We will not bend on this.

Judge:  On the advice of the Inqisitorial Representative, the penalty for these transgressions will be compulsory service in the Civil Defense Corps of the Flor do Mar of which the Accused is a citizen.  The Accused will surrender themselves for stasis and transit back to the Flor do Mar.
